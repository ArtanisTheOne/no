**Important Note**

*The bot's default prefix is !t (or !translate) - All commands must start with this prefix for the bot to process them.
Bot must have proper permissions in all relevant channels for full functionality (**read**, **write**, **react**, **mention**, **attachments**, **embed**).*

*Users who wish to receive automatic translations in private must **enable DMs** via **server privacy settings**.*

----

Automatically translates any new messages in the current channel and forwards them to you. Admins/mods can set forwarding to same channel, other channels or other users in the server. Messages in forwarded channels will also be sent back to origin*.

# Command
```c++
!translate channel from [lang] to [lang] for [dest]
```

# Parameters
* for **`[dest]`** _(optional)_  
Forwarding destination where the translated messages will be sent, defaults to "me" - translations sent via direct/private messages between you and the bot. Admins/mods can use discord mentions as forward destination with possibility to set multiple destinations at once. See examples below.

* to **`[lang]`** _(optional)_  
The language to translate to, defaults to server default language.

* from **`[lang]`** _(optional)_  
The language to translate from.

# Examples  
Using full language names
```c++
> !translate channel from [english] to [spanish]
```

Using language short codes
```c++
> !translate channel from [en] to [es]
```

Assigning a user as the target for translations
```c++
> !translate channel from [english] to [spanish] for [me]
```


## Server Admins/Mods
Send translations to same channel
```c++
> !translate channel from [english] to [spanish] for [#SameChannelMention]
```

Send translations to another channel in server
```c++
> !translate channel from [english] to [spanish] for [#OtherChannelMention]
```

Send translations to another user in server
```c++
> !translate channel from [english] to [spanish] for [@UserMention]
```

Send translations to multiple channels/users in server at once
```c++
> !translate channel from [english] to [spanish] for [#Channel1], [#Channel2], [@User1], [@User2]
```

## Stopping
To stop an automatic translation task, simply go the original channel and use the stop command:
```c++
> !translate stop  
> !translate stop for [me]
```

## Admins/Mods
Stop all automatic translations
```c++
> !translate stop for [all]
```

Stop all automatic translations for specific channel in server
```c++
> !translate stop for [#ForwardChannelMention]
```

Stop all automatic translations for specific user in server
```c++
> !translate stop for [@UserMention]
```

*Help command for stop: `!translate help stop`*

## Notes
*Help command for automatic translation: !translate help auto.*

Values wrapped in brackets **`[ ]`** mean user input.
**`[lang]`** values can be language names in English, native language names or ISO 639-1 codes. For example, **`german`** **`de`** and **`deutsch`** will all work the same.

Messages by bots are ignored.

Command messages are also ignored.

If you have a lot of users speaking a different language then it is advised you create a special public channel for them as a destination instead of having each one receive translated messages in private.
